# Command Line Chess

Welcome to Command Line Chess! This project is a chess game that is played directly in your command line, and it's implemented in Ruby.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. While the game is taking shape, there's still much to do. The goal is to create a fully functional chess game that follows all the rules of traditional chess, and that provides a fun and challenging experience for players of all levels.

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for future updates! As development progresses, new features and improvements will be added to the game.
